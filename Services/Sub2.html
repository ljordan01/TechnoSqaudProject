  <p class="sp">"THE YOUTH OF TODAY" </p>
  <p> "Our modern world is changing, and everyone is busy blaming the youth of today; </p>
  <p> But how can we blame the future, when it was us who made their world this way. </p>
  <p> Our street corners are full, as our children think that it’s okay to walk into the darkness with a knife;</p>
<p> When did we stop teaching our kids that the greatest ever gift, is quite simply LIFE. </p>
<p>Footballers earning a million pound a month, whilst children in Africa sit crying their hunger pain;</p>
<p>Pier pressure is weighing down our future generations, as they begin to buckle under the strain.</p>
<p>Our children are now living in a virtual world, with MSN, Facebook and Twitter, they no longer need to speak face to face;</p>
<p>If only they knew time was so valuable, and a lost childhood is the one thing that no one could ever replace.</p>
<p> Girls desperate to be thin, as their air brushed idols kneel at the toilet throwing up their breakfast, lunch and tea;</p>
<p>A silent generation sits texting on the latest mobile, whilst playing their PS3.</p>
<p>Faces hide behind hoodies, but not all youngsters want to go out and cause a riot;</p>
<p>Each of us is born with a hidden gift, but our future children have just forgotten how to find it.</p>
<p>We are leaving a broken planet to our children’s children, whilst our Governments just spout hot air, adding to our global warming;</p>
<p> With the worlds ice caps still melting, and our wildlife slowly disappearing, this is starting to sound more like a global warning.</p>
<p>Older generations demand respect, but its one way traffic, as respect back is something they do not show;</p>
<p>Instead of teaching our children how to fly, we tie them down with yet another ASBO.</p>
<p>Frustration and neglect flows through the streets of this concrete jungle, the one place that we now all call our home;</p>
<p> Bullies and racists still torture their victims, leaving them to cry in the shadows, all on their own.</p>
<p>Plastic surgery changing bodies, changing faces, as the years pass the dreams we all had as children slowly fade away;</p>
<p>Before long the dawn of a new generation will begin, and no doubt people will still be blaming,</p>
<p> The youth of today.""</p>
