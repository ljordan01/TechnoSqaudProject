      <h1>So, where do we start?</h1>

      <p> Having a healthy relationship between a parent and child is crucial for the child to become an independent adult. Parents are the most important figures to a child's life as they look up to them for approval, love and support. But, majority of the time, parents and kids have zero communication throughout the relationship and cannot properly understand each other.<p>

      <p> This website allows parents and children to talk and communicate with each other. Parents can leave comments about problems they are having with their child so that other teens can give advice on the situation. Kids can come and leave comments for parents that need help with their child.  It’s all based on coming to a common ground between parents and teens.</p>
